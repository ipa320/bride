Installation
------------

## From official ROS repositories ##

~~~ sh
$ sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-bride
~~~

## From source ##

~~~ sh
$ mkdir -p ~/git/bride_ws/src                  (or somewhere else)
$ cd git/bride_ws/src
$ catkin_init_workspace
~~~

Clone the release version of the BRIDE repository

~~~ sh
$ git clone https://github.com/ipa320/bride.git
$ cd ..
~~~

Install eclipse and the necessary plugins by building the workspace:

~~~ sh
$ catkin_make
~~~

Run bride from the workspace 

~~~ sh
$ source devel/setup.sh
$ rosrun bride eclipse
~~~


## Updating a source installation ##

If you installed BRIDE from source you can update your installed version by updating the repository with git:

~~~ sh
$ git pull origin develop
~~~

Afterwards start BRIDE as usually and go into the "Help" menu and select "Check for Updates". If there are updates in the generated plugins in the repository, Eclipse should install them during the update process.
