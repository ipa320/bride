<h1>Example 1 - Execution</h1>

<p></p>

<p>Exercise 1: Read Orocos Component Builder's Manual, Chap 2 sect 3 and 3.1</p>

<p>First, compile and run this application and try to start the component</p>

<p>from the TaskBrowser console. How often is updateHook() executed ? Why ?</p>

<p></p>

<p>Tip: In order to find out which functions this component has, type 'ls',
and</p>

<p>for detailed information, type 'help this' (i.e. print the interface of the
'this'</p>

<p>task object).</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, Set the period of the component in configureHook to 0.5 seconds and</p>

<p>make start() succeed when the period of the component indeed equals 0.5
seconds.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, add functions which use the log(Info) construct to display</p>

<p>a notice when the configureHook(), startHook(), stopHook() and
cleanupHook()</p>

<p>are executed. (Note: not all these functions return a bool!)</p>

<p></p>

<p>Recompile and restart this application and try to configure, start, stop</p>

<p>and cleanup the component.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Optional: Let the Hello component be created in the 'PreOperational'
mode.</p>

<p>What effect does this have on the acceptance of the start() method ?</p>

<p>Optional: Replace the Activity with a SlaveActivity. What are</p>

<p>the effects of trigger and update in comparison with the other activity
types ?</p>

<p>Optional: Replace the Activity with a SequentialActivity. What are</p>

<p>the effects of trigger and update in comparison with the other activity
types ?</p>
