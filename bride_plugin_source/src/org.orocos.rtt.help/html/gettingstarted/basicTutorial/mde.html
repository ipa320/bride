<h1>Model Based Development</h1>

<p>The basic workflow is:</p>

<p><strong>Model &gt; Code &gt; Deploy</strong></p>

<p>Please note: This is not a waterfall process but the different phases of
your own iterative process. You can model a litlle, code a litlle, then model
again, then code again... etc.</p>
<dl>
  <dt><strong>Model</strong></dt>
    <dd>Create an RTT Model of an Orocos package that contains one or more
      TaskContexts. For each TaskContext you can add:
      <ul>
        <li>Input Port</li>
        <li>Output Port</li>
        <li>Property</li>
        <li>Operation</li>
        <li>Activity</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Once you are satisfied with an initial model of your component(s) then
      you generate code based on the code. It is imortant to consider that you
      do not have to create the whole model from the start. You may want to
      just focus on one TaskContext. Add some code (next step) and then add
      some other element (eg a Port) and regenerate your code.</p>
    </dd>
  <dt><strong>Code</strong></dt>
    <dd>The generated code preseents you with an hpp and a cpp file for each
      TaskContext you have defined in the model. The hpp file should not be
      edited. Your implementation code should be added to the cpp file in
      between the marked comments that defire the protected areas for your
      code. When you regenerate code then you will not loose your own code as
      long as the code is within the protected areas.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Deploy</strong></dt>
    <dd>During deployment. You will use the command line tools provided by
      Orocos to deploy your components. This is how you test your code.
      Installiation of your compoentn depends on different configuration of
      your system platform (eg ROS). <em>Please refer to the specific system
      platform configuration information in the Reference section of this
      documentation</em>.</dd>
