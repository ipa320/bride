<h1>RTT Model-Based Development</h1>

<p>This is an introduction to Model-Based Development for the Orocos Real-Time
Toolkit (RTT) using BRIDE. We present the material in two parts. Part I is a
tutorial for learning how to build applications while Part II is a complete
application based on Motion Control for the KUKA YouBot.</p>

<h2>Model-Based Development</h2>

<p>Model-based development is based on the premise of first creating a model of
you system and then generate code from this model. The model can be
respresented as a diagram or a domain specific textual language. It is
important to note that it is very difficult to provide a tool which will
provide full code generation of an application, meaning, generation of code
that does not need to be edited in order to implement functionality. Yet, by
using Component Based Developement (CBD), we can use an MBD tool in two phases.
Phase I: is the compnent building phase where from a model we generate the
basic boilerplate code necesary for builing a complete component. During this
phase the implementation of the component is not generate. The implementation
is left to the component builder. Thus, a general approach to building a
component is to Model -&gt; Code -&gt; Deploy. The other phase of CBD is system
building where we do not create component from scracth but combine ready made
compponents into application. Thus in this second phase we can think of the
process as Model -&gt; Deploy.</p>

<h2>Component Based Development</h2>

<p>In CBD we strive to build modules that implement one specific functionaly of
the whole system. The funtionality is available for use by other comppnents and
in fact it may be the case that the funtionality of one component depends on
the funtionality of another comppnent. Components share thery funcitonalty with
other components via their interface. The interface is composed of ports and
operations. Operations can be grouped together as a service. Compnents that
need to work together are connected toghegher via their ports and through the
services they provide and require from each other.</p>

<p>Applications are built by connecting the components together. A complete
system is then deployed on a system.</p>

<h2>Orocos Real-Time Toolkit</h2>

<p>The Real-Time Toolkit (RTT) from Orocos is a real-time component based
development implementation. It provides the necessary code base and runtime
environment for builing component based applications. A component in RTT is
implemented as TaskContext. TaskContexts can have data ports which are
implemented as either an InputPort or an OutputPort which are used for
receiving or transmitting data between different components. Components provide
functionality via operations which are akin to methods or funchtions. Ports
and/or operations are the interface of the component. Data ports have to be
connected to each other using a ConnectionPolicy. Operations do not have to be
connected. Sometimes a TaskContext will need certain initial values to be set
in order for the TaskContxt to function properly when it is deployed. The
initial values needed are set by encapsulating the value in a Property for the
TaskContext.</p>

<h2>The 5 C's</h2>

<p>Building a component based application can be a daunting process if one is
not used to defining and grouping together similiar functionality into a
modular fashion. Throught this tutorial we will use a "simple" conceptual
framwork to help us define how to build our application which is based on what
we call the 5 C's:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Communication</li>
  <li>Computation</li>
  <li>Configuration</li>
  <li>Connectivity</li>
  <li>Coordination</li>
</ul>

<h2>Structure of the Tuturial</h2>

<p>The goal of this tutorial is to provide the necesary basic knowledge for
creating an application. We will build a two component system that will explore
the basic parts of components and we will introduce the 5 C's as we build our
application. Each chapter of this tutorial will have the same format where we
first introduce some concepts and then we follow the Model, Code, Deploy
process in the sections of each chapter.</p>
